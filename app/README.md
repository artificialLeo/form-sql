This project was created by me.

It's third version from scratch.

Technologies used:

react | react-router-dom | react-redux | redux-thunk | redux

@material-ui/core /icons /lab

express | cors | mongodb | mongoose | body-parser

It's simple clone of Instagram. Where I provided authorization and user creating via Auth0.
You cannot add user data. But can register  new user.

There is a bug you must reload page after login and each redirect.

App contain 2 pages login page and User Page.
User Page implemented with pagination. 
Also you can add your comment and like post across all users.
Page dont show you new comment immediately cause of bad plan but previous version of this app could do that.
